        <p>
          Welcome to PlayCoreDrive.com. We respect your privacy and are
          committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This document
          outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and the steps we
          take to protect it.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          PlayCoreDrive.com does not collect or store personal information from
          users such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers unless
          explicitly provided through our contact forms or booking processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our platform uses third-party services (such as booking systems and
          analytics tools) to enhance user experience. These services may
          collect anonymous usage data such as browser type, device information,
          IP address, and website interactions.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Any information collected is used strictly for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing users with personalized experiences;</li>
          <li>Improving the functionality and content of our website;</li>
          <li>
            Processing and managing hotel bookings or tournament participation;
          </li>
          <li>Responding to inquiries made through our contact forms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to understand and
          save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data
          about site traffic and site interactions to offer better site
          experiences.

          We may also integrate with trusted third-party APIs for hotel booking,
